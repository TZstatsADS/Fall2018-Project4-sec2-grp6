+ Project summary: In this project, we created an OCR post-processing procedure to enhance Tesseract OCR output. We understood and discussed the assigned paper D2 and C4, for the detection algorithm and correction algorithm separately. Then we implemented the corresponding algorithm to our project. Finally, performance measures are applied to assess the algorithms used in this project.
